# Preamble

Natureblocks is committed to providing an open standard for carbon
credit projects that ensures high levels of transparency, credibility,
and scalability using blockchain technology. The Open Impact Standard
(OIS) is designed to cater to project developers, validators, verifiers,
and methodology developers, streamlining the carbon credit creation and
verification process. It is vital that the Open Impact Standard is both
robust and collaborative to support the ongoing evolution of the carbon
credit market.

# Core Principles

1.  Environmental Integrity: The OIS aims to ensure credibility and
    transparency of the environmental contributions made by carbon
    credit projects. All projects under OIS must demonstrate real,
    measurable, and verifiable greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions.

2.  Sustainability: Projects under the OIS should pursue positive
    environmental, social, and economic benefits, and should be in line
    with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

3.  Transparency: The OIS promotes a transparent system where
    project-related information, documents, and methodologies are easily
    accessible to stakeholders, reducing the opportunities for fraud and
    mismanagement.

4.  Decentralization: Using the blockchain, the OIS allows for a
    decentralized approach to decision-making and approvals for
    methodologies and projects. Decision-making authority is given to
    the holders of the Open Impact Standard Governance Token (OISGT),
    ensuring a more diverse set of stakeholders participate in the
    decision-making process.

5.  Innovation: The OIS encourages continuous improvement and innovation
    of carbon reduction and removal methodologies to create a more
    efficient and scalable market for carbon credits.

# Core Requirements for Approved Carbon Projects

In order to be approved under the Open Impact Standard, a carbon project
must adhere to the following 5 core tenets:

1.  Real: The project must demonstrate that the carbon reductions and/or
    removals are genuine and have a tangible impact on the environment.
    The reductions must result in an actual decrease in GHG emissions.

2.  Measurable: The project must use accurate and reliable methodologies
    to quantify the carbon reductions and/or removals. This ensures that
    the estimated carbon credits are consistent and comparable across
    projects.

3.  Clear Ownership: The project must clearly define and establish the
    ownership of the carbon credits generated to avoid double counting
    and overlapping claims. This is essential for maintaining the
    credibility and integrity of the carbon credit market.

4.  Permanent: The project must ensure that the carbon reductions and/or
    removals have a lasting impact on the environment. This may involve
    ongoing monitoring, reporting, and verification processes to confirm
    the longevity of the project’s impact and address any potential
    reversals.

5.  Additionality: The project must demonstrate that the carbon
    reductions and/or removals would not have occurred in the absence of
    the project, i.e., they go beyond "business as usual" operations.
    This is crucial to ensure that carbon credits generated by the
    project represent a real, new, and increased effort toward
    mitigating climate change.

To maintain the credibility and effectiveness of the OIS, it is
essential for all participants involved in the carbon credit market to
adhere to the above principles and requirements. The OIS seeks to
encourage best practices, promote transparency, and foster innovation,
ultimately driving the carbon credit market forward and supporting
global efforts to address climate change.

# 1. Effective Date and Scope

## 1.1 Effective Date

**1.1.1** The Open Impact Standard (Version 0.1) is effective for all
projects seeking Natureblocks tokens (representative of carbon offsets &
credits) as of May 1st, 2023.

## 1.2 Scope

**1.2.1** The Principles & Requirements set out in this document apply
to all Project Developers and the Projects for which Natureblocks Tokens
— which represent carbon offsets & credits, are sought. It also
represents the Requirements against which Open Impact Standard
Validation and Verification Bodies (hereafter VVBs) shall Validate or
Verify the Project.

**1.2.2** The Requirements shall be applied as per the relevant sections
contained within this document and those associated or referenced.

**1.2.3** From time to time, Natureblocks may issue updates, changes,
clarifications, or corrections to the Requirements. These shall be
published on the Natureblocks Website. Natureblocks provides notice of
all such changes and specific dates for implementation and
applicability. It is the responsibility of the Project Developer to
remain up to date and apply all such updates as required for their
Project by checking the rule updates section on the Natureblocks
Website, regardless of whether a notification of change has been
received.

**1.2.4** Stakeholders — defined by holders of one or more Open Impact
Standard Governance Tokens, may submit suggested updates, edits,
changes, or additions to the Open Impact Standard through the
Natureblocks platform. Such requests shall be considered as per the
Standards Setting Procedure. Natureblocks reserves the right to accept
or reject such submissions at its own discretion.

**1.2.5** While Natureblocks will act as the initial contributors and
custodians of the Open Impact Standard, it is the intention that the
Open Impact Standard will be managed and maintained by the community of
stakeholders. Natureblocks will provide the necessary tools and
infrastructure to enable this transition to full community management.

# 2. Governance

The governance system of the Open Impact Standard is directly tied to
ownership of Open Impact Standard Governance Tokens (OISGTs). Governance
through OISGTs relies on a blockchain-based voting mechanism, where the
number of votes a participant has is proportional to the number of
OISGTs they own. For instance, if an individual possesses 10 OISGTs,
they are entitled to 10 votes.

The three primary matters subject to voting are the approval of
Validation and Verification Bodies (VVBs), approval of methodologies
through project schemas, and approval of projects.

## 2.1 Approval of VVBs

The competent Validation and Verification Bodies need to be approved
through the decentralized voting system. Open Impact Standard Governance
Token holders utilize their voting powers to decide on the acceptance or
rejection of VVBs, ensuring a transparent and decentralized
decision-making process.

## 2.2 Approval of Methodologies - Project Schemas

Methodologies are represented by project schemas that serve as
actionable guidelines for generating legitimate carbon offsets.
Governance Token holders vote on the approval of these schemas, enabling
a broad range of stakeholders to contribute to the development of
reliable and effective carbon offset methodologies.

## 2.3 Approval of Projects

Projects seeking Natureblocks tokens — following complete execution of a
Project Instance, also undergo a decentralized approval process.
Governance Token holders vote on the acceptance or rejection of proposed
carbon offset projects, ensuring that only credible, transparent, and
beneficial projects are approved by the Open Impact Standard.

# 3. Project Methodologies, Tools, and Project Schemas

Open Impact Standard employs project schemas as a way to define and
apply methodologies and tools for specific carbon offset projects. A
project schema is a complete series of actionable steps that anyone can
take to produce a legitimate carbon offset, corresponding to a
particular methodology and toolset.

# 4. Project Instances

Project instances are created when a project schema is invoked for a
specific carbon offset project. Each project instance requires the
project developer to follow the actionable steps outlined by the
corresponding project schema. This process facilitates the accurate,
in-depth assessment of the environmental impact and credibility of the
project, as well as providing a transparent basis for Validators and
Verifiers to review.

For example, in the case of the "Reforestation of Douglas Fir Trees on
Vancouver Island" project, the project developers would invoke the
Afforestation/Reforestation project schema and complete the required
steps. Validators and Verifiers will then evaluate the project against
the evidence and data provided in each step of the project instance.

Through the use of project schemas and project instances, the Open
Impact Standard establishes a transparent, consistent, and reliable
approach towards the assessment and development of carbon offset
projects. Adherence to the standardized methodologies and tools laid out
within the relevant schemas ensures that each project contributes to
genuine, measurable, and long-lasting efforts to mitigate climate
change.

# 5. General Eligibility Criteria

## 5.1 Conformance with Applicable Laws

Projects must adhere to all relevant local, national, and international
legal and regulatory requirements within the country the project is
located.

## 5.2 Location

Projects may be located anywhere in the world; however, if a project is
located outside of the jurisdiction of any of the United Nation member
states, the project developer must clarify their right to operate in the
project area.

## 5.3 Project Area

The total area for a given project must be clearly defined. The right to
operate within the area must also be specified.

## 5.4 Exclusivity to the Open Impact Standard

Projects submitted to the Open Impact Standard must not be included in
any other standard, unless explicitly allowed by an Open Impact Standard
variance. This is to prevent double counting of carbon offsets and
credits.

## 5.5 Project Ownership and Stakeholder Participation

Projects must have clearly defined and unambiguous ownership structures
and must include active stakeholder engagement throughout the project’s
lifecycle.

## 5.6 Inclusion of Project Validation and Verification Bodies (VVBs)

approved by the Open Impact Standard Governance Token holders,
maintaining the integrity and accountability of the project.

## 5.7 Transparent Information and Methodologies

Projects must follow an approved Open Impact Standard methodology
schema. Schemas are approved by the Open Impact Standard Governance
Token holders in order to provide transparent information on
methodologies, calculations, and monitoring plans while ensuring that
all required documentation is publicly accessible.

# 6. Closing Comments
