Boundaries of the project area shall be clearly distinguishable in the field. 5 3. Under the Open Impact Standard the project area is divided in Modelling Units (MU) for an efficient calculation of the amount of Certified SDG Impact Statement or Product (for example GSVERs). The 'project area' as the area of certification shall be limited to eligible areas, any riparian or other buffer zones located within eligible areas, and areas set aside for conservation in accordance with Open Impact Standard LUF requirements. Project Types A grouped project encompasses several single area projects but applies the 'Land Use & Forests Requirements' in the same way as a single area project. Grouped projects are similar to a Programme of Activities (PoA) under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), allowing for an unlimited number of new project areas to be added without undergoing the complete Gold Standard certification process. The project developer can add new areas to a project (grouped projects) or expand an existing project area (single area projects) at any time after a project reaches Registered status.
